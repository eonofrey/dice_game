# dice_game

So my friend introduced me to a dice game that goes as follows: 

Everyone sits in a circle and takes turns rolling two dice. 

- The number you roll is the score you get
- You can roll as many times as you want and you get to add the score of each roll to your total score
- If you roll doubles, you get 2x what you roll BUT you have to roll again 
- However, if you roll a 1 on either die you get a 0 for your turn and it is over
- If you roll two 1's your total score goes to 0, unless you're already at 0 in which case it goes to -50
- If you roll and your total score = 100 you go back down to 0
- Once one player gets above 100 everyone Venmo's her (winner's score - their score) * 5 cents 


I did terribly in this game which was mostly luck, but now I'm curious if there's a dominant strategy to it. I plan to try a few simple strategies using Monte Carlo simulations in this project.
